    Downloads an audio file from the given URL, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper,
    splits the transcription into sentences, estimates durations for each sentence,
    labels each sentence's speaker using OpenAI GPT, and returns a structured Conversation.

    Args:
        audio_url (str): The URL of the audio file to process.

    Returns:
        Conversation: A Conversation object containing a list of Messages with sender labels,
                      durations, and transcribed text.

    Raises:
        Exception: Propagates exceptions raised during download, transcription,

    Notes:
        - This function performs I/O-bound operations asynchronously.
        - If speaker labeling fails or mismatches sentence count, it falls back to alternating labels.
